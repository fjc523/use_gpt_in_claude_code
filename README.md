# co-claw-dex

## 配置与启动

### 1. 配置凭证

优先使用环境变量：

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

也可以使用本地配置文件：

- `~/.codex/auth.json`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`

最小配置示例：

```toml
model_provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-5.4"
disable_response_storage = true

[model_providers.openai]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

### 2. 安装与构建

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. 启动命令

```bash
node cli.js --help
npm start
```

### 4. 快速验证

```bash
node cli.js auth status --text
node cli.js -p "Reply with exactly: hello"
```

`co-claw-dex` is a locally runnable Claude Code-style coding agent fork that swaps the original model provider boundary for an OpenAI/Codex-compatible Responses backend.

The goal is not to redesign the CLI. The goal is to preserve the terminal UX, tool system, permission model, and agent flow while replacing the model runtime with an OpenAI-compatible backend.

The canonical implementation truth now lives in the governed `docs/` tree. Historical research material is preserved separately and should not be used as the implementation source of truth.

## Canonical Docs

- `docs/INDEX.md` is the canonical documentation router.
- `docs/implementation/hybrid-native-implementation-plan.md` is the implementation source of truth for the next coding phase.
- Archived research notes under `research/` remain useful as historical input, but implementation decisions are now consolidated into the docs tree.

## Highlights

- Preserves the Claude Code-style terminal experience instead of rebuilding the agent stack from scratch
- Uses an OpenAI/Codex-compatible Responses backend as the default model runtime
- Reuses Codex-style local auth and config sources such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `~/.codex/auth.json`, and `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Translates Responses streaming events back into the existing internal stream format so the CLI behavior stays familiar
- Translates function calling into the existing tool-use flow, including stateless replay for providers that do not reliably support `previous_response_id`
- Keeps legacy Claude-style model aliases for compatibility with existing workflows
- Disables official Anthropic install/update flows for this fork distribution
- Ships with source-first helper scripts for build, smoke testing, local activation, and rollback

## Status

This repository now builds and runs as a usable coding agent platform.

What is already migrated:

- OpenAI/Codex-compatible Responses backend is the default model path
- Credentials are loaded from `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `~/.codex/auth.json`
- Provider settings are loaded from `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Responses streaming is translated into the existing internal message stream
- Function calling is translated into the existing internal tool-use flow
- Legacy Claude-style model aliases are preserved for compatibility
- Official Anthropic install/update release-channel flows are disabled for this fork

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node cli.js --help
```

Basic verification:

```bash
node cli.js auth status --text
node cli.js -p "Reply with exactly: hello"
```

Launcher helpers:

```bash
npm run activate-cli
npm run restore-cli
```

One-command smoke check:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

## Credential Sources

This fork reuses Codex-style local configuration.

Expected credential sources:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `~/.codex/auth.json`

Expected provider settings source:

- `~/.codex/config.toml`

Typical values used by this fork:

- model provider base URL
- default model
- wire API mode
- response storage preference

Minimal provider config example:

```toml
model_provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-5.4"
disable_response_storage = true

[model_providers.openai]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

## Architecture

The migration keeps the original runtime shape as intact as possible.

Instead of rewriting the agent stack, the fork translates at the provider boundary:

- Internal prompt and message flow remain Claude Code-shaped
- Internal tool orchestration remains Claude Code-shaped
- OpenAI Responses requests are generated from existing message history
- Responses streaming events are translated back into the existing stream event format
- Function calls and function-call outputs are replayed statelessly for compatibility with proxy providers that do not reliably support `previous_response_id`

This means most of the original CLI, Hermes-style component behavior, and tool plumbing can remain unchanged while the underlying model runtime is replaced.

## Notes

- `cli.js` at the repo root is a thin launcher for the built artifact in `dist/cli.js`
- This fork is intended to be run from source, not upgraded from official Anthropic distribution channels
- `claude update` and `claude install` are intentionally disabled from pulling official Anthropic releases in this fork

## Origin

This codebase began as a source extraction from the published Claude Code bundle and was then patched into a local, buildable, OpenAI/Codex-adapted development workspace for personal use.
